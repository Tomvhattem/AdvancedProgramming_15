# Advanced Programming | ALDH1 Inhibition Prediction.

This project focuses on the use of the preprocessed data to train several machine learning networks to predict ALDH1 inhibition.

## Notebooks

The project consists of the following notebooks:

- `EDA.ipynb`: This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the project. It provides insights and visualizations to understand the dataset.

- `MachineLearning.ipynb`: This notebook showcases the machine learning approaches employed for solving the problem. It includes the training and evaluation of various models on the dataset.

## Scripts

In addition to the notebooks, the project includes the following scripts:

- `MachineLearning_Exploration.py`: This script explores different machine learning approaches, such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for solving the problem. It provides a comparative analysis of these models.

- `preprocessing.py`: This script contains the data preprocessing steps required for the project. It processes the data to prepare it for the EDA and machine learning stages.

## Data

The project utilizes the following datasets:

- `test_molecules_v2.csv`: Processed data that serves as one of the input datasets for the EDA and machine learning notebooks.

- `tested_molecules-1.csv`: Processed data used for training and testing machine learning models.

- `untested_molecules.csv`: Data on which the machine learning models have to make predictions. This dataset contains the values to be predicted.

- `processed_data.csv`: Processed data saved during the data preprocessing steps.
